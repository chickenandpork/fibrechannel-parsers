 *
 * The DWHURLConnection collects ocidwh:// sources from OCI's backend database to search for aliases
 *
 * This collector/parser chain is more successful than text-based parsers simply because
 * it avoids human-error and the error of not reading the warning to avoid putty log traces
 * and other "nearly 100% unmodified" methods of transferring content.  Additionally, this
 * is an entirely binary connection, so the user cannot accidentally edit the content.
 * Finally, as BNA may harvest from and provide config to many fabrics at once, this is
 * typically "a broader net to cast" to collect information.
