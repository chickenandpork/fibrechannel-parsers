The \doxyref{Ali\+Show\+Zone\+Parser}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1zone_1_1AliShowZoneParser} parses the output of a Brocade S\+A\+N switch with the \char`\"{}alishow\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}zoneshow\char`\"{} commands.

As always, this parser is more successful when the content is treated like binary\+: don't edit it. In particular, the use of a putty log to capture output while querying the switch leads to parser exceptions because the interactive "you have connected to blah blah system version 1.\+2.\+3, the weather is fabulous and I have 42 pages of boilerplate to spit out before you enter the command for aliases... hit enter to continue... have some backspaces..." is included. As are the backspaces.

When collecting aliases using an ssh command, it's better to execute that command noninteractively\+:

This parser is not normally used from a downloaded text; it's normally used when a client executes a query against the backing database of a B\+N\+A instance. The resulting query tends to have data columns in resultset that are binary-\/coded to reduce parsing load. These same binary tokens are parsed by \doxyref{B\+N\+A\+Zone\+Parser}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1zone_1_1BNAZoneParser} to provide results similar to Ali\+Show\+Parser.

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If a zone has two \char`\"{}fcalias name X\+X\+X\char`\"{} values, it may be applied to both sets of members 
\item If a zone has a device-\/alias, the name will not get resolved; this assumes that if the name is known, ever, it'll be somewhere in the file (which will cause a name/wwn mapping to be added) 
\item If a zone has a device-\/alias, the dereferenced name's W\+W\+N will not get added to the zone (yet) 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

As are the backspaces.

When collecting aliases using an ssh command, it's better to execute that command noninteractively\+:

In U\+N\+I\+X, Linux, Ubuntu, O\+S\+X, or the 6000 other licensees of the U\+S\+L codebase\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}ssh username@switch44.example.com "show zone" > switch44.shzone
\end{DoxyVerb}


In windows, using the {\tt putty} tools\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}plink.exe -l username -pw p4ssw0rd switch44.example.com "show zone" > switch44.shzone
\end{DoxyVerb}


This leads to a better chance to parse 100\% of the output with more accuracy, but I guess following this recommendation is up to the user, and to the engineer suggesting how he or she should collect the text for parsing.

\begin{DoxyVerb}zone name SANASVR001_FabA vsan 100
  fcalias name Oracle_123466 vsan 100
    pwwn 10:00:00:00:c9:12:34:66

  fcalias name HDS0123457_CL7F vsan 100
    pwwn 50:06:0e:80:12:34:56:78

  fcalias name HDS0123457_CL7F vsan 100
    pwwn 50:06:0e:80:12:34:56:79

zone name SANASVR002_FabA vsan 100
  fcalias name Oracle_123467 vsan 100
    pwwn 10:00:00:00:c9:12:34:67 \end{DoxyVerb}


The resulting content from this example would be the following W\+W\+P\+N/alias pairs\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}10000000c9123466,"Oracle_123466"
10000000c9123467,"Oracle_123467"
50060e8012345678,"HDS0123457_CL7F"
50060e8012345679,"HDS0123457_CL7F" \end{DoxyVerb}
 \section{S\+S\+H Query}\label{SSHURLConnection}
The \doxyref{S\+S\+H\+U\+R\+L\+Connection}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1ssh_1_1SSHURLConnection} batch-\/executes a command via S\+S\+H \section{Virtual\+Wisdom4 Validation Errors}\label{VW4InvalidAdded}
The \doxyref{V\+W4\+Invalid\+Added\+Parser}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1zone_1_1VW4InvalidAddedParser} interprets the error content of a Virtual\+Wisdom4 Entity validation exception

a Virtual\+Wisdom4 Validation error message is typically a long set of multi-\/line messages such as\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}Invalid entity type
Entity: Oracle44 : banana
Location: [Line : 2 , Column : 19]

New port entities can not be imported. These are automatically discovered.
Entity: a12345_CL0B : fcport
Location: [Line : 16 , Column : 7]

Duplicate entity in import file
Entity: a12345_CL1B : fcport
Location: [Line : 23 , Column : 7]

Location: [Line : 1234 , Column : 7]
Invalid added child entities : 20c2000dec123456
Entity: Cisco-000dec-123456:194 : hba \end{DoxyVerb}


The result is a list of nicknames, all of which say that the W\+W\+P\+N has a nickname of \char`\"{}none\char`\"{} -- for example, as if the \doxyref{Nickname\+Parser}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1zone_1_1NicknameParser} had read content such as\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}20c2000dec123456,"none" \end{DoxyVerb}


This format has limited facility\+: it's intended for cases where an error message is used to exclude entities from an import file. In such case, the same import would be used to generate a list of W\+W\+P\+N/alias combinations, then the \char`\"{}exclusion\char`\"{} list would be read using this parser.
