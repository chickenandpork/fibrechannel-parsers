The \doxyref{Ali\+Show\+Zone\+Parser}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1zone_1_1AliShowZoneParser} parses the output of a Brocade S\+A\+N switch with the \char`\"{}alishow\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}zoneshow\char`\"{} commands.

As always, this parser is more successful when the content is treated like binary\+: don't edit it. In particular, the use of a putty log to capture output while querying the switch leads to parser exceptions because the interactive "you have connected to blah blah system version 1.\+2.\+3, the weather is fabulous and I have 42 pages of boilerplate to spit out before you enter the command for aliases... hit enter to continue... have some backspaces..." is included. As are the backspaces.

When collecting aliases using an ssh command, it's better to execute that command noninteractively\+:

In U\+N\+I\+X, Linux, Ubuntu, O\+S\+X, or the 6000 other licensees of the U\+S\+L codebase\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}ssh username@switch44.example.com "alishow" > switch44.alishow

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item On the system of I\+B\+M Systems Director, initiate \char`\"{}cimcli\char`\"{} command to check for Brocade switch zone members.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

(1) Query switch zones\+: cimcli [-\/s] -\/l [Brocade S\+M\+I Agent I\+P]\+:[Brocade S\+M\+I Agent port] -\/u [Brocade S\+M\+I Agent user\+I\+D] -\/p [Brocade S\+M\+I Agent password] -\/n root/brocade1 ni Brocade\+\_\+\+Zone Parameter \char`\"{}-\/s\char`\"{} specifies to connect over H\+T\+T\+P\+S.

(2) For each returned Brocade\+\_\+\+Zone path in step (1) that contains \char`\"{}\+Instance\+I\+D=\char`\"{}true", query its zone members\+: cimcli [-\/s] -\/l [Brocade S\+M\+I Agent I\+P]\+:[Brocade S\+M\+I Agent port] -\/u [Brocade S\+M\+I Agent user\+I\+D] -\/p [Brocade S\+M\+I Agent password] -\/n root/brocade1 an [Brocade\+\_\+\+Zone path] -\/ac Brocade\+\_\+\+Zone\+Membership\+Setting\+Data\+In\+Zone -\/rc Brocade\+\_\+\+Zone\+Membership\+Setting\+Data

Parameter \char`\"{}-\/s\char`\"{} specifies to connect over H\+T\+T\+P\+S. Attention\+: In Brocade\+\_\+\+Zone path, add slash before quotation marks, like this\+: Brocade\+\_\+\+Zone.\+Instance\+I\+D=\textbackslash{} \char`\"{}true;\+H\+M\+C\+\_\+\+Managed\+\_\+\+Zone;100000051\+E\+C\+A\+A229\textbackslash{} \char`\"{}

(3) In Step (2), if it returns no zone members for a certain zone, which does not match the switch zone configurations, that zone could include offline zone members. \section{Brocade B\+N\+A back-\/end Database}\label{BNAPURLConnection}
The \doxyref{B\+N\+A\+P\+U\+R\+L\+Connection}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1bnapsql_1_1BNAPURLConnection} collects bna\+://, bnapsql\+://, cmcne\+://, and dcfm\+:// sources from B\+N\+A's backend database to provide the bnazone-\/formatted zone and alias information

This collector/parser chain is more successful than text-\/based parsers simply because it avoids human-\/error and the error of not reading the warning to avoid putty log traces and other \char`\"{}nearly 100\% unmodified\char`\"{} methods of transferring content. Additionally, this is an entirely binary connection, so the user cannot accidentally edit the content.

The \doxyref{B\+N\+A\+Zone\+Parser}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1zone_1_1BNAZoneParser} parses the binary text records in a B\+N\+A server representing the zonesets and their aliases

This parser is not normally used from a downloaded text; it's normally used when a client executes a query against the backing database of a B\+N\+A instance. The resulting query tends to have data columns in resultset that are binary-\/coded to reduce parsing load. These same binary tokens are parsed by \doxyref{B\+N\+A\+Zone\+Parser}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1zone_1_1BNAZoneParser} to provide results similar to Ali\+Show\+Parser.

There are times that the backing database is easier to query than switches

Use this parser automatically by collecting using a bnapsql\+:// U\+R\+L protocol with the \char`\"{}vict\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}vw4tools\char`\"{} project. For example\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}java -jar vict.jar -N bnapsql://bna.example.com/

As always, this parser is more successful when the content is treated like binary\+: don't edit it. In particular, the use of a putty log to capture output while querying the switch leads to parser exceptions because the interactive "you have connected to blah blah system version 1.\+2.\+3, the weather is fabulous and I have 42 pages of boilerplate to spit out before you enter the command for aliases... hit enter to continue... have some backspaces..." is included.

The \doxyref{Show\+Zone2\+Parser}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1zone_1_1ShowZone2Parser} parses the output of a Cisco S\+A\+N switch with the \char`\"{}show zone\char`\"{} command in a more aggressive manner

This parser was added based on Grzeg Sliwka running into some of the most interesting zones I have seen. I don't think it will handle every situation, as follows\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If a zone has two \char`\"{}fcalias name X\+X\+X\char`\"{} values, it may be applied to both sets of members 
\item If a zone has a device-\/alias, the name will not get resolved; this assumes that if the name is known, ever, it'll be somewhere in the file (which will cause a name/wwn mapping to be added) 
\item If a zone has a device-\/alias, the dereferenced name's W\+W\+N will not get added to the zone (yet) 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

As always, this parser is more successful when the content is treated like binary\+: don't edit it. In particular, the use of a putty log to capture output while querying the switch leads to parser exceptions because the interactive "you have connected to blah blah system version 1.\+2.\+3, the weather is fabulous and I have 42 pages of boilerplate to spit out before you enter the command for aliases... hit enter to continue... have some backspaces..." is included. As are the backspaces.

When collecting aliases using an ssh command, it's better to execute that command noninteractively\+:

In U\+N\+I\+X, Linux, Ubuntu, O\+S\+X, or the 6000 other licensees of the U\+S\+L codebase\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}ssh username@switch44.example.com "show zone" > switch44.shzone
\end{DoxyVerb}


In windows, using the {\tt putty} tools\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}plink.exe -l username -pw p4ssw0rd switch44.example.com "show zone" > switch44.shzone
\end{DoxyVerb}


This leads to a better chance to parse 100\% of the output with more accuracy, but I guess following this recommendation is up to the user, and to the engineer suggesting how he or she should collect the text for parsing.

The parsers in this project work on a text stream -- the less butchered and corrupted that text stream is, the better the chance that they'll work.

I spend a lot of time trying to fake around \char`\"{}-\/-\/\+M\+O\+R\+E-\/-\/\char`\"{} and various A\+N\+S\+I Escape Sequences and to be honest, I'm really quite frustrated trying to get users asking for help to read a few rules\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item non-\/interactive. As in \char`\"{}not a log of my typing\char`\"{}. think \char`\"{}batch mode\char`\"{}. 
\item Every parser says \char`\"{}treat like binary\char`\"{}, and \char`\"{}don't edit\char`\"{}, and \char`\"{}in particular, the use of a putty log [is bad]\char`\"{}. Make sure you've seen that part. 
\item this means \char`\"{}plink.\+exe\char`\"{} not \char`\"{}putty.\+exe\char`\"{}. Seriously. If you don't know why, see the first rule, and check out the difference in these tools. It's O\+K, I'll wait for you. Here's a hint\+: it tends to lead to the next one 
\item No A\+N\+S\+I escape sequences. See also \char`\"{}non-\/interative\char`\"{}, above. Interactive terminals include \char`\"{}hit [\+E\+N\+T\+E\+R] to continue\char`\"{} and some screen-\/formatting with A\+N\+S\+I escape sequences. 
\item I literally spend more time un-\/butchering A\+N\+S\+I escape sequences than I spend writing code. Quit it. Seriously. Read the bits above. If I suspect that reading of the bits above has not occurred, I will send you to this page. 
\item please, for the love of all things holy, please read the bits above 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

This parser detects when the rules above have not been read. \section{Virtual\+Wisdom4 Validation Errors}\label{VW4InvalidAdded}
The \doxyref{V\+W4\+Invalid\+Added\+Parser}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1zone_1_1VW4InvalidAddedParser} interprets the error content of a Virtual\+Wisdom4 Entity validation exception

a Virtual\+Wisdom4 Validation error message is typically a long set of multi-\/line messages such as\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}Invalid entity type
Entity: Oracle44 : banana
Location: [Line : 2 , Column : 19]

New port entities can not be imported. These are automatically discovered.
Entity: a12345_CL0B : fcport
Location: [Line : 16 , Column : 7]

Duplicate entity in import file
Entity: a12345_CL1B : fcport
Location: [Line : 23 , Column : 7]

Location: [Line : 1234 , Column : 7]
Invalid added child entities : 20c2000dec123456
Entity: Cisco-000dec-123456:194 : hba \end{DoxyVerb}


The result is a list of nicknames, all of which say that the W\+W\+P\+N has a nickname of \char`\"{}none\char`\"{} -- for example, as if the \doxyref{Nickname\+Parser}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1parser_1_1zone_1_1NicknameParser} had read content such as\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}20c2000dec123456,"none" \end{DoxyVerb}


This format has limited facility\+: it's intended for cases where an error message is used to exclude entities from an import file. In such case, the same import would be used to generate a list of W\+W\+P\+N/alias combinations, then the \char`\"{}exclusion\char`\"{} list would be read using this parser.
